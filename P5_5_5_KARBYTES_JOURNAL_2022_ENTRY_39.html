<p>28_AUGUST_2022: I accidentally missed court yesterday. On top of that, I have at least one BART fare evasion citation I have to pay. Last time I was in court, the judge said that he was considering sentencing me to be detained so that I would be forced to show up to court. I am afraid that, because I missed court and have yet to pay off all of my BART fare citations, my background check with Amazon will not be approved. I am also afraid that I will be &#8220;randomly&#8221; detained and thrown into prison at any point in the future. I checked the Dublin court website and saw that the court is closed until Monday. In order to avoid getting penalized (no guarantee of that), I plan on going to the court on Monday and seeing if I can sign up for a new court session to make up for missing court yesterday.</p>
