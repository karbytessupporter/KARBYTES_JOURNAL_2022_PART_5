<p>05_SEPTEMBER_2022: 28_AUGUST_2022: As much as I dislike having to keep calling attention to the ugly, pestering female caricatures which I imagine in order to personify the psychotronic harassment I routinely am bombarded with, I feel obliged to provide one more example. Unlike Samantha, Boo Boo is more demure sounding (i.e. uses a soft breathy lolita voice (while Samantha projects her voice with more force)) and more babyish (i.e. hardly enunciates words and does a lot of uptalking (i.e. expressing statements which makes them sound more like questions than declarations)). I find her extremely abhorrent; more so than <a style="background:#000000;color:#ff9000;" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_40/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samantha</a>. Samantha seems more educated, worldly, and independent than Boo Boo (but both girls are incessantly vocal, impatient, selectively responsive, passive aggressive, and nagging, and very demanding of attention). While Samantha makes snarky remarks, Boo Boo whimpers with her mouth closed in wounded falsetto, cheerlessly giggles, and whispers breathily. Boo Boo breathes noisily and erratically through a tiny-sounding throat and mouth with soft gasps which sound expectant or else surprised. Boo Boo speaks with a lisp which sounds childish and unprofessional. The most annoying sound Boo Boo makes could just as easily be Samantha going berserk: mooing angrily and demurely in a sing song manner and in a wailing manner while lips are sealed. What is particularly invasive is the sense that those caricatures are trying to superimpose their breathing and vocalizations over mine. Itâ€™s like an angry little girl is trying to use me as her cathartic release valve.</p>
