<p>28_AUGUST_2022: Today I &#8220;snapped&#8221; and decided to start playing my music as loudly as possible via my laptop whenever I am in noisy public spaces where I feel that my personal space is deliberately being encroached upon by sadistic people who want to push me to my breaking point. Perhaps I will download some more music with violent and/or annoying themes. I have some very annoying, loud trippy electronica to play for the time being. (Sadly, my over-ear headphones are broken. I just wear them to signal that I prefer more quiet than what is currently available). It&#8217;s not fair that only people who are in groups are allowed to dominate the public soundscape. Hence, I am striking back by playing obnoxious music in their midst at full volume. Suck it, vermin! Go ahead and play your rat music on top of mine such that we generate a wall of noise and no one can hear themselves talk.</p>
